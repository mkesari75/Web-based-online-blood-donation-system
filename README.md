# Web-based-online-blood-donation-system
Web based online blood donation system is built up on JSP with mySQL database.

Objective:
The aim of this project is to develop a web-based platform that connects blood donors and recipients in a safe and efficient manner. The system will facilitate the process of blood donation by providing a platform where donors can register, and recipients can search for donors in their area. The system will also include an admin panel that allows organizations to manage blood donation drives and monitor donor activities.

Features:

Receiver Model: The receiver model will allow individuals in need of blood to search for donors based on blood type, location, and availability. They can send requests to donors and receive responses on the platform.

Donor Model: The donor model will allow individuals to register as blood donors by providing their personal information and blood type. Donors can update their availability and receive requests from recipients.

Organization Model: The organization model will allow blood banks and other organizations to manage blood donation drives, add and manage donors and receivers, and track blood inventory.

Admin Model: The admin model will allow system administrators to manage user accounts, monitor system activities, and generate reports.
Technologies:

JSP: The front-end will be developed using JSP for dynamic web page creation.
MySQL: The back-end will use MySQL for database management.
Java: The system will be built using Java for server-side scripting.
HTML/CSS: HTML and CSS will be used for creating the user interface.

Team:
The project was developed by a team of three individuals with experience in JSP, MySQL, and Java.
